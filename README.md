Predicting Earthquake Magnitude: Insights from 28 Years of Seismic Data

This project explores global earthquake patterns using a dataset of 994 recorded earthquakes from 1995 to 2023. Through data visualization, correlation analysis, and machine learning, key insights were uncovered, such as:

âœ… Asia and Oceania experience the most earthquakes, with Japan, Indonesia, and the U.S. being the most affected.
âœ… Higher-magnitude earthquakes often trigger tsunamis, emphasizing the need for early warning systems.
âœ… Shallow earthquakes (< 70 km) tend to be more destructive.
âœ… Random Forest was the best-performing model for magnitude prediction, achieving an MSE of 0.1365.
